Exercise 14: Diagnosing Performance Issues

Description: 

Explain how to use the React Profiler to identify and optimize slow components.




Answer:
The React Profiler, available in React DevTools, is a powerful tool for identifying and optimizing performance issues in React applications.

By recording a profiling session, you can:

Track Component Renders:
Identify which components rendered during a specific interaction or state change, including unnecessary re-renders.

Measure Render Duration:
See how long each component took to render, helping pinpoint slow or inefficient components.

Visualize with Flame Charts and Ranked Charts:
Use visual charts to understand the render hierarchy and identify which parts of the UI are the most performance-intensive.

Analyze Commit Phases:
Review each render cycle (commit) to understand how your app updates over time.

This information allows developers to make data-driven optimizations, such as memoization, code splitting, or avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

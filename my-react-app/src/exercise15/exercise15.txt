Exercise 15: Integrating Next.js

Description: 

Briefly explain how to integrate Next.js for server-side rendering.


Answer:
Answer:
Next.js is a React framework that simplifies server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), improving performance and SEO.

Key features include:

File-based Routing: Pages are automatically routed based on the file structure inside the pages directory.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Use getServerSideProps to fetch data at request time and render pages on the server.

Static Site Generation (SSG): Use getStaticProps to pre-render pages at build time for faster load speeds.

Automatic Code Splitting: Loads only the necessary JavaScript for each page to optimize performance.

Built-in API Routes: Create backend endpoints directly inside the pages/api directory.

To integrate Next.js, start a project using npx create-next-app, define your pages in the pages directory, and use Next.js data-fetching methods to control rendering behavior.

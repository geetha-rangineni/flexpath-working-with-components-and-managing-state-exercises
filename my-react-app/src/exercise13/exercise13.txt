Exercise 13: Debugging with React DevTools

Description: 

Explain how to use React DevTools to inspect components and their state.


Answer:
React DevTools is a browser extension that enables developers to inspect and debug React applications more effectively.

With React DevTools, you can:

Inspect the Component Tree:
Visualize the full hierarchy of React components currently rendered on the page, including both functional and class components.

Examine Props and State:
Select any component to view its current props, state, and context in real time, making it easier to debug data flow issues.

Edit Props and State on the Fly:
Modify props and state directly from the DevTools to test changes without editing code.

Performance Profiling:
Use the Profiler tab to analyze component render times and identify performance bottlenecks.

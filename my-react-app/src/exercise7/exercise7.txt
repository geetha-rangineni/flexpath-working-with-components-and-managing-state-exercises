Exercise 7: Understanding React Context

Description: 

Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using React `Context`.


Answer:
Benefits:

Avoids Prop Drilling
Enables passing data through the component tree without manually forwarding props at every level, making code cleaner and easier to manage.

Simplifies Global State Management
Ideal for managing application-wide settings like themes, language preferences, or authenticated user information in a centralized and accessible way.


Drawbacks:
Performance Concerns
When the context value changes, all consuming components re-render, which can negatively impact performance if the context is updated frequently or holds large objects.

Reduced Component Reusability
Components that rely directly on a specific context become more tightly coupled, making them harder to reuse in different environments or projects without that context.

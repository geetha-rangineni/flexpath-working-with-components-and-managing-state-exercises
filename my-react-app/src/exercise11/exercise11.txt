Exercise 11: Benefits and Limitations of HOCs

Description: 

Discuss the use cases and limitations of Higher-Order Components.

Answer:
Use Cases of Higher-Order Components (HOCs):
Code Reusability:
HOCs allow you to extract and reuse common functionality across multiple components without repeating code.

Cross-Cutting Concerns:
Ideal for handling concerns like logging, authentication, authorization, or data fetching in a consistent and centralized manner

Limitations of Higher-Order Components:
Wrapper Hell:
Using multiple HOCs can result in a deeply nested and hard-to-read component structure, making debugging more difficult.

Props Collisions:
HOCs and wrapped components may use the same prop names, leading to conflicts unless managed carefully.

Less Intuitive Compared to Hooks:
HOCs can be harder to follow, especially for developers new to React. Hooks offer a more straightforward and modern approach to handling shared logic.
